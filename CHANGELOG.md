## 1.0.0rc5 - 2015-12-22

Fifth release candidate.

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#42](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/42)
  fixes some grammatical issues in the questions presented by the installer.
- [#45](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/45)
  fixes how JS and CSS assets are added to zend-view templates.
- [#48](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/48)
  adds unit tests for the `OptionalPackages` class (which provides the Composer
  installer scripts).
- [#49](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/49)
  updates the Pimple support to Pimple v3, ensuring Pimple users are using the
  latest stable release.

## 1.0.0rc4 - 2015-12-09

Fourth release candidate.

### Added

- [#34](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/34)
  updates the zend-view configuration to register a factory for
  `Zend\View\HelperPluginManager`, as well as a `view_helpers` sub-key for
  registering custom view helpers.
- [#37](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/37)
  creates the subdirectories `src/App/` and `test/AppTest/`, moving the
  subdirectories of each under those, and updating the `composer.json`
  autoloading directives accordingly. This change will allow new projects to
  implement a "modular" structure if desired, with a subdirectory per namespace.
- [#41](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/41) adds
  the composer script "serve", which fires up the built-in PHP webserver on port
  8080; invoke using `composer serve`.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#23](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/23)
  updates the comment for the glob statements to ensure all 4 (not just 2!)
  possible matches are detailed.
- [#24](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/24)
  updates the `config/config.php` file to store cached configuration as a plain
  PHP file, so that it can simply `include()`; this will be faster than using
  JSON-serialized structures.
- [#30](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/30)
  updates the Twig configuration to follow the changes made for
  [zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer 0.3.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer/releases/tag/0.3.0).
  The old configuration format will still work, though users *should* update
  their configuration to the new format. The change in this patch only affects
  new installs.
- [#33](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/33)
  updates to zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers `^1.2`.
- [#33](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/33) adds
  configuration for auto-registering the new `Zend\Expressive\Helper\UrlHelperMiddleware`
  as pipeline middleware; this fixes an issue when using the zend-view renderer
  with the `url()` helper whereby the `UrlHelper` was being registered as a
  route result observer too late to receive the `RouteResult`.
- [#40](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/40)
  renames the namespace for the installer to `ExpressiveInstaller`.

## 1.0.0rc3 - 2015-12-07

Third release candidate.

### Added

- [#20](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/20) adds
  the ability to specify a "minimal" install; when selected, the installer will
  install modified configuration, omit some files, and remove the default
  middleware and public assets.
- [#27](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/27) adds
  [zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers)
  as a dependency, and integrates the helpers into the configuration.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#13](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/13)
  updates the installer to also remove the dependency on composer/composer
  on completion.
- [#11](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/11)
  moves the route middleware service definitions into the routes configuration
  files.
- [#21](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/21)
  updates `require` statements in generated configuration files to use the
  `__DIR__` constant to ensure files are located relative to the origin file.
- [#25](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/25) and
  [#29](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/29)
  update minimum versions for each router and template implementation (final
  versions for RC3 are all at `^1.0`).
- [#29](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/29) sets
  the zend-expressive required version to `~1.0.0@rc || ^1.0`, to ensure a
  stable version is always installed.
